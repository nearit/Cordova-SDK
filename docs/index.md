NearIT allows to engage app users by sending **context-aware targeted content**.

## Recipes
NearIT allows to manage apps by defining "recipes". Those are simple rules made of 3 ingredients:

* **WHO**: define the target users
* **WHAT**: define what action NearIT should do
* **TRIGGER**: define when the action should be triggered

<br>
## How it works
[**NearIT web interface**](https://go.nearit.com/) allows you to configure all the features quickly.
Once the settings are configured, **everyone** - even people without technical skills - can manage context-aware mobile content.

**NearIT SDK** synchronizes with servers and behaves accordingly to the settings and the recipes. Any content will be delivered at the right time, you just need to handle its presentation.
